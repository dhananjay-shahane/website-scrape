## Overview

1. **Google Maps Scraper**: Scrapes business details (name, category, address, website, phone) from Google Maps for specified locations and search queries.
2. **Email Extractor**: Takes the CSV output from the Google Maps Scraper and finds email addresses from the business websites.

## Requirements

- NPM
- The following npm packages:
  - playwright
  - csv-parser
  - csv-writer
  - fs (built-in)
  - path (built-in)
  - os (built-in)
  - worker_threads (built-in)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install playwright csv-parser csv-writer
```

3. For Playwright, you'll need to install browsers:

```bash
npx playwright install chromium
```

## Script 1: Google Maps Scraper

This script scrapes business information from Google Maps for specific search queries and locations.

### Features

- Multi-location support
- Multiple search queries per location to overcome limits
- Parallel processing with batching
- Retry mechanisms for reliability
- Detailed logging and progress monitoring
- Avoids duplicates across queries
- CSV output with business details

### Configuration

Edit these variables at the top of the script:

```javascript
const baseNameSheet = 'home_dec';           // Base name for output files
const batchSize = 10;                       // Number of businesses to process in parallel
const maxBusinessesToScrape = 0;            // Set to 0 for no limit

// Define locations and search queries
const locations = [
    {
        name: 'toledo_spain',
        queries: [
            'https://www.google.com/maps/search/Furniture+stores+in+toledo+spain',
            'https://www.google.com/maps/search/Interior+design+stores+in+toledo+spain'
        ]
    }
    // Add more locations as needed
];
```

### Usage

Run the script:

```bash
node google-maps-scraper.js
```

### Output

The script will create a `data` directory with two types of CSV files:
- Location-specific CSVs with columns: Name, Category, Address, Website, Phone, URL
- Combined CSV for all locations with columns: Location, Name, Category, Address, Website, Phone, URL

Example output filenames:
- `home_dec_toledo_spain_2025-04-09_19-46.csv`
- `home_dec_all_locations_2025-04-09_19-46.csv`

## Script 2: Email Extractor

This script takes the output CSV from the Google Maps Scraper and extracts email addresses from business websites.

### Features

- Multi-threaded processing using worker threads
- Smart email ranking algorithm
- Caching to avoid re-scraping
- Contact page detection
- Email filtering to avoid common non-personal emails
- CSV output with original data plus email column

### Configuration

Key settings at the top of the script:

```javascript
const config = {
  dataDir: path.join(__dirname, 'data'),            // Input/output directory
  inputFilename: 'home_dec_toledo_spain_2025-04-09_19-46.csv',  // Input file from scraper
  outputFilename: 'home_dec_toledo_spain_2025-04-09_19-46_emails.csv',  // Output file
  requestDelay: 300,                                // Delay between requests
  maxRetries: 3,                                    // Retries per website
  parallelScrapers: Math.max(1, Math.min(os.cpus().length - 1, 8)),  // Number of parallel threads
  maxEmailsPerSite: 3,                              // Limit emails per business
  removeRowsWithoutEmails: true,                    // Filter out rows without emails
  useWorkerThreads: true,                           // Use multi-threading
  cacheResults: true                                // Cache results
};
```

### Command Line Arguments

You can override configuration settings with command line arguments:

- `--limit N`: Process only the first N websites
- `--max-emails N`: Maximum emails to extract per site
- `--input filename.csv`: Input CSV file
- `--output filename.csv`: Output CSV file
- `--parallel N`: Number of parallel workers
- `--no-limit`: Don't limit the number of emails per site
- `--keep-empty`: Keep rows without emails in the output
- `--no-workers`: Disable worker threads
- `--no-cache`: Disable result caching

### Usage

Run the script:

```bash
node email-extractor.js
```

Or with options:

```bash
node email-extractor.js --limit 50 --max-emails 5 --input my-businesses.csv --output with-emails.csv
```

### Output

The script adds an "Emails" column to the original CSV data, containing found email addresses separated by commas.

## Performance Considerations

- These scripts are resource-intensive and may require adjustment based on your system capabilities
- For larger datasets, consider increasing the batch size and parallel workers
- Be aware of potential rate limiting from Google Maps and websites
- Adjust timeout values if you're experiencing connection issues

## Ethical and Legal Considerations

- Always respect website terms of service and robots.txt
- Consider website server load when scraping
- Be mindful of local privacy laws regarding email collection
- This tool is intended for legitimate business research only

## Troubleshooting

- If the Google Maps Scraper fails, check if Google Maps has changed its DOM structure
- If websites aren't loading, try increasing navigation timeout
- If you're getting blocked, adjust request delays and consider using proxies
- Check debug screenshots in the data directory for visual troubleshooting
